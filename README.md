# Mini game: Primality test

## Requirement: 
Implement two functions:
- First function to check a number is a prime or not
- Second function to get array of all prime numbers that is less than or equal a number

I have wrote the instruction in [example.rb](https://github.com/gagoit/primality-test/blob/master/example.rb), plz follow it and implement your algorithm.

## Steps to do:
- git clone https://github.com/gagoit/primality-test.git
- create & checkout to new branch
- implement your algorithm (see [example.rb](https://github.com/gagoit/primality-test/blob/master/example.rb) for more detail)
- test (see [primality_test.rb](https://github.com/gagoit/primality-test/blob/master/example.rb) for more detail)
- push code
- create new pull-request
